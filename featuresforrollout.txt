Here are the features we are going to roll out in out final production of this project
1. Stock_data_fetching
  we will use yahoo y finance library that will the fetch the stock historical data using requests library
  Data we will be fetching -
  Stock_open = the stock open refers to price of the stock at the beginning of the trading day
  Stock_high = the stock open refers to highest price of the stock in an specific time period such as intraday
  Stock_low = can be understood from above
  Stock_close= can be understood form above
  Volume = the total shares of that stock traded on that day
  Adj. close_price= The adjusted close price is the closing price of a stock, but it has been adjusted for events such as stock splits, dividends, or rights offerings.
  User_input = user will be able to input the ticker(NASDAQ SYMBOL) for that particular stock he/she wants to see the historical data
  Date_fetching = user will be able to set the time period for which he wants to fetch historical data.
2.Data Preprocessing and Calculations:
  Feature: Data cleaning and manipulation using pandas(will learn the library first from free code camp).
  Tasks:
  Handle missing data points (fill or drop missing values).
  Convert date columns into appropriate formats.
  Calculate technical indicators:
  Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
  Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
